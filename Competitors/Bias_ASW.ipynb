The focus is on the sensors and other mechanical components whose function consists of collecting environmental information to help the robot interpret \"his state in the world\".▪️ On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence specialises in building algorithms for different knowledge fields to work with vast quantities of information. The focus is on the algorithms designed to evaluate the data and make proper decisions.▪️ So, Why are we often pairing robotics with Artificial Intelligence?Exists a hybrid approach that started to grow in the latest years due to the recent artificial intelligence boom; this one combines AI and robotics.▪️ The robot hardware (the body) is responsible for collecting the environmental information, and the software, composed of controllers and AI algorithms (brain), takes the collected data and gives it an appropriate use to help the robot fulfil its assignments properly.#equinoxailab\\xa0#robotics\\xa0#airobots\\xa0#robots\\xa0#artificialintelligence', 'Do you want to know how AI drives Robotics?▪️User experience with robots \\U0001faf1🏻\\u200d\\U0001faf2🏽▪️AI improving robots interactions with humans 🦾▪️The phenomenon of Uncanny Valley🤖Read our article written by our Data Scientist Juan Sebastián Casas Castillo here: https://lnkd.in/dyafySzd#equinoxailab\\xa0#robotics\\xa0#airobots\\xa0#robots\\xa0#artificialintelligence', '… and what’s AI for you? 💻🤖\\U0001faf1🏻\\u200d\\U0001faf2🏽🧠 Write it in the comment section ⬇️#artificialintelligence #equinoxailab', 'In a vast universe, humans are small, but together we can create something big!...Stay tuned 👀🌌#artificialintelligence #dataengineering  #datascience #equinoxailab', 'Are you passionate about Computer Science, research and innovation? 🧠🦾💻Start your career, learn and change the world through technology!Stay tuned 👀🌌', 'Daniela, Fabian and Favio are part of our team, and they have something in common...

       " 'Robotics and Artificial Intelligence seem to be constantly connected, but did you know they have different technological approaches?▪️ On the one hand, in robotics, people design, develop and build machines to execute jobs in an autonomous or semi-autonomous way. The focus is on the sensors and other mechanical components whose function consists of collecting environmental information to help the robot interpret \"his state in the world\".▪️ On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence specialises in building algorithms for different knowledge fields to work with vast quantities of information. The focus is on the algorithms designed to evaluate the data and make proper decisions.▪️ So, Why are we often pairing robotics with Artificial Intelligence?Exists a hybrid approach that started to grow in the latest years due to the recent artificial intelligence boom; this one combines AI and robotics.▪️ The robot hardware (the body) is responsible for collecting the environmental information, and the software, composed of controllers and AI algorithms (brain), takes the collected data and gives it an appropriate use to help the robot fulfil its assignments properly.#equinoxailab\\xa0#robotics\\xa0#airobots\\xa0#robots\\xa0#artificialintelligence',\n",
